# Hajkey Community Code of Conduct

The Hajkey Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our community behaves and what we value as members and project to others. This Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and as deemed necessary.

The Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize non-native speakers of English or any other language. Instead the Code of Conduct spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be acceptable and unacceptable.

It is important to assume good faith and remember that many of our contributors may have different backgrounds which could color their approach in all things.

## Conduct

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#4-unacceptable-behavior); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact conduct@hajkey.org. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome

Try to avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your community members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about and develop cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

## Moderation

**People who have an issue or questions about a potential Code of Conduct violation can raise it by writing an e-mail to [conduct@hajkey.org](mailto:conduct@hajkey.org)**

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
